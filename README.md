newrelic

This module installs and configures the newrelic server monitoring agent and various plugins from the newrelic plugin directory.

Puppet 3+ only
-------------

Due to this module's dependency on [ripienaar/module_data](http://forge.puppetlabs.com/ripienaar/module_data), this module will only work with puppet 3+.

Since I am no longer using any puppet lower than 3, and there are so many great things about puppet 3+ that make it *far* superior to puppet 2.x, I'm standardizing on only supporting puppet 3+ for my own modules.
Hiera data binding alone is enough for me to standardize on puppet 3+, and all of my modules are designed for use with hiera data binding.
